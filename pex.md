## Abstract

This HIP specifies a binding of the DIF Presentation Exchange pattern to IPFS & Hedera Consensus Service as part of the Guardian architecture. An authorized actor (e.g.an Auditor or Regulator) is able to access non-public attributes associated with a sustainability project by proof of their certications attached to an HCS message requesting that access. By using HCS, we ensure a provable history of request & response for such protected attributes.

## Motivation

The Guardian Selective Disclosure architecture allows a Guardian admin to stipulate what attributes within a Verifiable Credential (VC) should not be available to the 
public, but rather only to authorized requestors. For such a VC, the corresponding Verifiable Presentation (VP) published to IPFS will not contain those protected attributes, but rather a 'Presentation Definition' indicating the nature of the proof required to access them. If and when some other actor is able to demonstrate the stipulated proof on a request as a 'Presentation Submission', the protected attributes will be released to them. 

## Rationale

The DIF Presentation Exchange specification (https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/) defines an abstract pattern between a Verifier and a Holder - specifically 
"a way for Verifiers to describe proof requirements, and for Holders to describe submissions of proof which align with those requirements."

This specification defines a binding of this abstract pettern for the Guardian Selective Disclosure architecture that uses IPFS & Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)

## Specification

### High-Level Flow

1. A Guardian implementation, acting as a Verifier, publishes a protected VP to IPFS. The VP indicates that there are non-public attributes available to requestors that have a certain role. Thism is the Presentation Definition.
2. An Auditor is notified of the availability of the non-public attributes. They determine they meet the necessary authorization rule
3. The Auditor, acting as a Verifier, creates an HCS message requesting access to the non-public VP. The HCS message carries a VP proving their certification. The HCS message is submitted to the Hedera network. This is the Presentation Request
4. The Guardian implementation is notified of the request. It validates the Verifiers's VP and compares the certifications within the Verifier's VC to the Presentation Definition

### Presentation Definition

How does a Verifier create and publish to Holders a Definition?

### Presentation Submission

How does a Holder present a VP that meets the requirements of the Definition?
