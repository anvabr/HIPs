## Abstract

This HIP specifies a mechanism for locking up HBARs into an account such that those HBARs can be used only for rent payments for both the account and other state entities that designate the 
locked account as their autoRenewalAccount. By eliminating the possibility of a CryptoTransfer removing HBARs from a locked account and guaranteeing that any HBARs in the account be used 
only for rent payments,  

## Motivation

With Hedera turning on 'rent' for state entities like accounts, tokens, topics, and contracts , there is the potential for those objects to be
removed from state if rent is not paid. While mechanisms like stake rewards, token royalties, and contract fees can trickle HBARs into an account in order
to fiund rent payments for both the account and connected state entities - nothing would prevent the owner of that account using their private key to transfer
those HBARs out of the account - and so effectively preventing future rent payments. 

Even just the possibility of rent payment failure and consequent state deletion may negatively impact the assurance and valuation that participants ascribe to 
Hedera state entities.

## Rationale

The Sustainability ecosystem building on Hedera creates provenance chains between HTS tokens representing ecological benefits like carbom removal or renewal energy credits 
and the physical reporting data that justifies the minting of the NFT instance. An enterprise considering buying such a carbon credit in order to offset their own
carbon emissions must be confident that they will be able to subsequently sell or 'retire' that NFT.
